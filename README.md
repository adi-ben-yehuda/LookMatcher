# LookMatcher

In this repository, we have created an Android\IOS app. This is the client side. You can find the server side [here](https://github.com/ShaharMosh/server)

## General Information

### Creating a new user
On the registration screen, the user must fill in the following details: first name, last name, email, password and password verification. After filling in all the details correctly and clicking on the register button, the user will be transferred to the home screen of the application. If one of the details is filled in incorrectly (empty field / incorrect email or password, etc.), an error message will appear.

### Login
the user must fill in the email and password with which they registered for the application. If the details are indeed correct, you will be transferred to the home screen in the application. If not, an error message will appear.

### Search for a garment
The customer chooses one or more of the available options in the following fields: gender, category, color, size and store. After clicking the search button, he will be shown items that match the search he made. Each item will display a name, photo, price and company. In addition, the items displayed on the screen can be sorted by price - from low to high or from high to low and by distance - depending on the user's location, the items can be sorted according to the locations of the branches.

### Item screen
When the user clicks on one of the items displayed on the search results screen, he will be taken to the item screen. On this screen, several pictures of the item, the name of the item, color, price, size and company will be displayed. In addition, you can go to the item screen on the company's own page. You can also open a map and it will show the location of the user, the location of the branch of the company to which the item belongs, closest to the user and the locations of all the branches of the company.
